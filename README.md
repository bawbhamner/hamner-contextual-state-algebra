# Hamner Contextual State Algebra (HCSA)

Author: Robert Hamner

This repository contains a preprint draft of **Hamner Contextual State Algebra (HCSA)**,
an algebraic framework for modeling context-sensitive computation.

The work introduces a context-indexed transition operator that generalizes
classical state-transition systems such as finite-state machines and labeled
transition systems.
